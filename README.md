Here's a quick snippet to get info on `John Wilbanks`_. :

    >>> import pyorcid
    >>> #retrieve john's profile from his ORCID
    >>> orcid_res = pyorcid.get('0000-0002-4510-0385')
    >>> print (orcid_res.family_name)
    wilbanks

What if you'd like to see an author's works or areas of interest? :

    >>> print (orcid_res.keywords)
    []
    >>> print (orcid_res.publications)
    []

Hm, let's try another author. ::

    >>> alfonso = pyorcid.get('0000-0001-8855-5569')
    >>> print (alfonso.keywords)
    [u'computer science', u' bioinformatics', u' computational biology']
    >>> print (alfonso.publications[0])
    <Publication "A note about norbert wiener and his contribution to harmonic analysis and tauberian theorems">


Maybe you'd like to read about Mr. Wiener's contributions? ::

    >>> print (alfonso.publications[0].url)
    http://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-67650513866&partnerID=MN8TOARS

### Searching

If you'd rather search for authors, try ORCID's search functionality using its
[API specification](https://members.orcid.org/api/tutorial/search-orcid-registry) :

    >>> #do a simple author search for john
    >>> authors = pyorcid.search('family-name:wilbanks+AND+given-names:john')
    >>> print (next(authors).family_name)
    wilbanks
